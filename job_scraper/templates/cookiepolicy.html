                <p>
                    A cookie is a small file, typically of letters and numbers, downloaded on to a device when the user accesses certain websites. Cookies are then sent back to originating website on
                    each
                    subsequent
                    visit. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user’s web browser or device.

                    Cookies on our websites may be set by us, by third parties under contract with us, or by independent third parties such as advertisers.

                    Our site makes use of both ‘session’ and ‘persistent’ cookies. ‘Session’ cookies remember information from page to page for filtering and completing searches before being removed
                    when you
                    end
                    your
                    session. ‘Persistent’ cookies enable our websites to recognise you when you make return visits to us, and remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a
                    specified
                    expiry
                    date.
                    Persistent cookies placed on your computer as a result of your use of our websites will never be stored for longer than 2 years from the date of your last visit.

                    The table below sets out the various types of cookies we use, why we (or relevant third parties) use them, and includes information you can use to control and learn more about the

                    Our website tries to serve advertisements that are relevant to you by displaying Google AdSense interest-based advertisements. These are tailored by Google using cookies which will
                    track
                    your behaviour across the web, again using anonymous statistical rather than personally identifiable information. Third party advertisers may also use cookies, for such purposes of
                    ensuring relevant advertisements are being displayed, to help prevent the same adverts being served twice to the same user, and to ensure that adverts are correctly sized and don’t
                    detract
                    from your experience of the site.
