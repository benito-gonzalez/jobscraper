                        was made to help people interested about the jobs market from Finland.

                        Based on personal experience, for a person is not easy to find the open jobs available at a certain time. Also, companies that are interested to fill in certain open positions
                        they
                        have, sometimes struggle to get the exposure they want.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As it can be seen above, the website is mainly targeting people who are looking for a job, or interested about what opportunities are available.
                        However, companies can also benefit from our website, by getting bigger exposure to potential candidates.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Recruiters may also be interested in utilising our website, getting access to certain metrics, to allow them to find out easier what companies may benefit the most from their
                        expertise. More on recruiters later on, when we have enough relevant data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At this point, we are working on adding more companies to the website and to enhance the user experience, therefore more insights will be revealed as we can showcase the
                        features.
                    </p>
